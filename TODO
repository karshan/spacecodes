[Features]
 - Show spell hotkeys in ui. and update icons to ones that are actually available
 - Don't allow station selection
 - Display blinking messages differently

[Bugs]
 - Recover when packets from both clients are dropped on the same frame
 - [P4] move_unit() moves slower around turns
 - It is possible to send 2+ blink commands or intercept commands etc. in the same frame because the cooldown/gold doesn't update until apply_updates() is called

[Hygiene]
 - Remove unit.dead (atleast don't check it all over the place)
 - Use with_serde feature of raylib to get Vector2 serde instance
 - game_state.selection type should be isomorhpic to (bool, bool, Vec<unit_id>)
 - unit.blinking: Option<bool> is ugly make a better type for this
 - shop ui code isn't great it should probably use a HashMap<ShopItem, Icon>

[Performance]
 - No/minumum heap use
 - Packed bools and structs
 - maximise cache utilization, iterate through units just once per frame
 - function inlining?
 - frame type i64->u32
